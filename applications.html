            JEVASOL PVOH-based films is a packaging material that has unique properties (a hyperlink to CAPABILITIES)
            that solve the problem of environmental pollution and harmful to humans. These films are environmentally
            friendly and fully biodegradable when disposed of in water or waste. JEVASOL's water-soluble packaging
            technology is durable, elastic and flexible to pack your product, as it should be packed.

            JEVASOL films are an environmentally friendly solution that helps the consumer with accurate product dosage
            and safe handling/storage of toxic/hazardous products. JEVASOL films are used to pack agrochemicals, dyes,
            cements, food additives, fish baits, seeds, contaminated clothing, toilet blocks, powder and liquid
            detergents, and food to keep them from absorbing external odors. This unique solution and wide applications
            can revolutionize the future of the packaging industry.

                        Chemicals used in agriculture are usually very toxic, cause severe pollution and endanger our
                        health. Therefore more and more attention have been paid to the safety of agricultural packaging
                        materials.
                        Although chemicals in conventional agricultural packaging have been used for a long time, they
                        have two major drawbacks:<br>
                        - a liquid agricultural chemical is packed in glass bottles that break easily and cause a toxic
                        chemical to leak out;<br>
                        - a large number of chemical residues in the package leads to the formation of a large amount of
                        chemical waste that pollutes the soil and water, which in the long term is dangerous for the
                        environment.

                        Hydrographic printing, also known as water transfer printing, is a unique process that adds
                        visual appeal to any surfaces. The process begins with a drawing printed on a water-soluble
                        JEVASOL film and after printing the desired pattern, three-dimensional objects can be immersed
                        in a floating JEVASOL film with a pattern, so that the ink pattern is transferred to an object
                        of complex shape, and the film dissolves.
