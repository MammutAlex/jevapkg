            <p class="lead">
                <h4 class="d-inline">Polyvinyl alcohol</h4>, also known as PVOH, PVA, or PVAL, is a synthetic polymer that is soluble in water. It
                is effective in film forming, emulsifying, and has an adhesive quality. It has no odor and is not toxic,
                and is resistant to grease, oils, and solvents. It is ductile but strong, flexible, and functions as a
                high oxygen and aroma barrier.

            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                While other vinyl polymers are prepared by polymerization of its corresponding monomer, PVA undergoes
                either partial or complete hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate to remove acetate groups. To ensure lubricity
                and binding action in order to protect the fibers and help with handling, sizing is a processing
                mechanism applied to rovings and yarns.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                299 and 399 organic sizing, which is composed of PVA and additives such as plasticizers, lubricants,
                etc.) is designed to facilitate easy removal through heat cleaning. The key raw material to create PVA
                is the vinyl acetate monomer. The monomer is manufactured through the polymerization of vinyl acetate.
                Then it goes through partial hydrolysis, which consists of partial replacement of the ester group in
                vinyl acetate with the hydroxyl group, completed in the presence of the aqueous sodium hydroxide. After
                the gradual addition of the aqueous saponification agent, the PVA is precipitated, washed and dried.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mb30 text-center">Creating Polyvinyl alcohol</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                There are two ways in which the 4% aqueous solution of Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) may be created. The first
                uses a conventional heating method, the second uses the microwave heating method. The latter is easier
                to conduct and is less time-consuming. Once the 4% PVA solution is made, it can last between 6 and 8
                weeks. Generally, it is advisable to refrigerate this solution, which supports the growth of bacteria.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                When making the Polyvinyl alcohol solution, it is recommended to use tap water, as bacteria grows faster
                in PVA containing distilled water.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb40">
                By annealing amorphous PVA films above 85°C, the glass transition temperature, semi-crystalline films of
                PVA were prepared. This allowed macromolecules to form crystallites, stabilizing the films and inducing
                a chemically cross-linked behavior.

            <h4 class="mb30 text-center">Uses of Polyvinyl alcohol</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                Polyvinyl alcohol is widely used to strengthen textile yarn and papers, particularly to make the latter
                more resilient to oils and grease. It is also used in freshwater sports fishing. PVA is added into bags
                that are filled with oil-based or dry fishing bait and attached to the hook. As PVA is soluble in water,
                when the bag lands on the bed of the water, it breaks down, leaving the hook bait surrounded by pellets
                and ground bait. This attracts fish to the hook bait, although the PVA does cause the plastic to
                dissolve in water.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                PVA may also be used as a coating agent for food supplements and does not pose any health risks as it is
                not poisonous. One of the leading industrial uses for PVA is for food packaging, accounting for 31.4
                percent of the global share in 2016. To combat moisture formation from foodstuff, PVA film is created to
                be thin and water-resistant. Its crosslinking density and resistance to moisture are added benefits to
                its usability in this area.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Polyvinyl alcohol is a resin, a natural or synthetic organic compound made of non-crystalline or viscous
                substance. Hence, it is often utilized as the starting point for the creation of other resins such as
                polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or polyvinyl formal (PVF). PVB has an adhesive quality and is a water-resistant,
                plastic film, which is often used to laminate safety glass for vehicles. PVF is commonly used to
                insulate wires.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb60">
                It is also interesting to note that in another growing market, the pharmaceutical market, use of
                polyvinyl alcohol for coating of medicinal tablets is quite prominent. Its various chemical properties
                have shown the benefit of its use in health applications, and in particular in pharmaceutics. However,
                extensive experimentation and pharmaceutical use of PVA/PVOH has been limited due to regulations on food
                and drugs.

            <p class="lead mb40">
                Over the course of the last several years, the biodegradable polymer market has gone through a series of
                compilations and transformations in the United States. In 2016, polyvinyl alcohol market was at an
                estimated 172.8 kilotons of material. Due to stricter regulations regarding disposal and decreasing
                availability of landfills, there is a greater demand for sustainably packaged versions of the product.
                With the advent of new technology surrounding renewable natural polymers, polyvinyl alcohol has become a
                highly lucrative due to its biodegradable quality, under certain microbial conditions.

                Furthermore, given its varied application and usability, PVA is in demand in various industrial markets
                such as textile, coatings, paper, ceramics, and wood. Since polyvinyl alcohol consists of ethanol and is
                water soluble, while being resistant to greases and oils, it is a unique polymer, with few capable
                substitutes.

                Chemicals used in agriculture are usually highly toxic, cause severe pollution and endanger our health.
                Therefore, people have been paying more attention to the materials of agricultural packaging. Although
                being used for a long time, chemicals of regular agricultural packaging have three main disadvantages:
                - liquid agriculture chemical is packed in glass bottles which are easily breakable, and cause leakage
                of toxic chemical.
                - a lot of leftover in packaging produces a large amount of chemical waste.
                - if the agricultural chemical packaging with leftover were to be discarded in rivers, rivulets, farms
                or terra, etc. it would pollute the soil and water, which would be hazardous to the environment in the
                long term.

                collection containers or as independent storage bags for soiled or contaminated items (i.e. used
                continence pads and bed linen) prior to laundering, thus minimising the risk of cross contamination or
                direct exposure to waste materials or body fluids. Closed Laundry Bags can be placed directly into the
                washing machine. During washing, the water soluble transparent bags dissolve, releasing the contents
                into the wash.
